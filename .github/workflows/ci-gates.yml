          This file is required by PR-1.

          Purpose:
          - Provide reproducible steps to validate the PR in a clean environment.
          - Later, this must include the MVP minimal chain smoke steps.

          Current status: placeholder (early-repo phase).

          cat > artifacts/runbook/versions.txt <<'EOF'
          # PR-1 Versions (placeholder)

          Record toolchain/runtime versions used for reproduction.

          Current status: placeholder (early-repo phase).

          cat > artifacts/audit/dependency-integrity-report.md <<'EOF'
          # Dependency Integrity Report (placeholder)

          PR-1 minimum placeholder.

          Note:
          - Gate scripts currently produce `ci_artifacts/dependency-audit.md`.
          - This file will be populated by CI by copying/transforming that report.
